# Day 20

Day 20 is pretty easy once you grok the t1rick they neglectd to provide a sample for or document in the instructions.
In other words, the only real challenge to day 20 is incomplete instructions and incomplete examples.
The trick being that the infinite void can't be assumed to always be dark - although it always starts that way before any enhancement.

I was disappointed to see the 50th enhancement didn't appear to result in any ascii art of any sort - still just noise.
