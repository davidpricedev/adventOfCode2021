# Snailfish math

This one is challenging. Using a binary tree makes split, magnitude, and addition really easy, but leaves explode insanely difficult.
Trying to treat it as a single list of numbers and symbols would make split and magnitude really difficult, but may make explode more tolerable.
If I make it easy to switch back and forth, maybe I can get the best of both worlds?
