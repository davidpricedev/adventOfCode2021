# adventOfCode2021

This repository contains my solutions for many of the puzzles in the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) 2021.

As I usually do, I've decided to learn a new language while solving these puzzles. This year the new language is ruby.

Next year, it might be fun to review [this dynamic programming course](https://youtu.be/oBt53YbR9Kk) before tackling the advent of code. Having it fresh in mind might make some of the problems easier - or at least provide a few different ways of thinking about problems.
